 /*Everything started at the Big Bang, in the Fortnite universe, (or should i say the "fortnite Omniverse", their big bang was caused by what we call the "Zero Point".Its its a powerful energy source who created all type of reality and he is the only pillar of reality itself, if he is destroyed, everything is also destroyed.To protect himself, the Zero Point created an island with a powerfuland living storm on it.One day, a group of lads called the Imagined Order(I.O) has take control of the Zero Point.Their objective ? Trap some randoms peoples of multiples universe inside "The Loop" for some reasons.The Fortnite island is basically a time loop.Everyone trapped inside start to lose his memoriesand the ability to speak(so yeah Rick and Naruto and John Wick ect are trapped inside the loop) and also are forced to fight each others All the lads trapped inside the loop will be called " The loopers ".The loopers have different ability's like : A blue power called "Reboot" that can turn a cube into friendly, the ability to steal powers of peoples they defeated by taking their items, are also weapons expert, they are espionage expert an have some hidden powerful minds. Thousands of years ago, an other group called " The Seven" have for objective to stop the I.O to continue their things by releasing all loopers ( at least trying ) They members are ( in their order of appearance ) : The Visitor, the first Seven member to appears in season 4 chapter 1, inside a meteor, he managed to leaved with a rocket and leaved behind him a giant reality crack thing in the sky. The Scientist, the funny guy of the group, he appears in season X and the Zero point crisis at the end of chapter 2. He also builded a rocket to leave but at the end, him and the other Seven leaved behind them The Black Hole

The paradigm : the girl of the group, we are not sure if she is REALY canon but some peoples think that she is also the Guard of The Vault ( The inside of the Zero point ). The Scientist tried to contact her in Season X without success. The Foundation : Its the Rock and he created The Seven. The Origin : we know nothing about him, the only thing we have is a concept art of him, we still don't know who it is how he realy looks like. The Sisters (they are apparently 2) : we also know nothing about them, accept an concept art, the sisters are only mentioned by The Foundation in the trailer of Season 6 C2, they are maybe lost somewhere. On The seven members, we still don't know nothing about 3 of them, for now. So know im gonna start to describe all the events that happens in the Fortnite Story line :

1000+ years ago, The Imagined Order discovers The Zero Point and enslaves it, constructing The Bridge (their base)and containing The Zero Point within it. They send Agent Jones into the Zero Point to see what happens, and he survives, ending up on the Island. They create The Loop, a 22 minute time loop that is used to trap anyone who arrives on the Island. The Loop uses The Storm to push combatants together over the 22 minute period, eventually closing all the way in and killing anyone trapped in it. If someone is to be the last standing in the loop, at the exact closing point of the storm, they will escape the loop and be sent unto the Island, free from the Loop. They use the Zero Point to travel to and from different realities and use it to alter various realities, changing their courses of development drastically, often disastrously, in their pursuit of knowledge and power. Eventually, The Imagined Order began experimenting with The Loop, kidnapping people from different realities and trapping them on the island, where they fought again and again in a battle royale. The Seven fear them and the potential catastrophic damage they could cause to the Omniverse as a whole. 

In season 3, a meteor have been seen in the sky, it crashed in season 4 with, in it, The Visitor who manged to escape. The rocket (piloted by the Visitor inside) takes off from the Villain Lair, (some random place on the map) leaving behind a thick trail of smoke as it ascends into the sky. It momentarily stopped in the air to break off its rocket booster, before accelerating quickly. Once reaching a high altitude, the rocket shut off its engines and stalled in the air, before plummeting back down towards the island. the Visitor could be heard saying 'Zero Point Oscillator on, Setting coordinates. Engaging quantum field accelerator. The rocket activated a laser that pointed directly at Tilted Towers, and boosted towards the location. However, before it could hit, the Visitor activated a device on his rocket and temporarily opened a 'sideways' rift 'between' two distinct realities. Effectively acting as a portal to The In-Between, the realm of The Zero Point, which could be subsequently manipulated with the 'Zero Point Oscillator' to travel through time, space, or both. It can strongly be assumed that the Visitor's 'Quantum Field Accelerator' acted as the device necessary to manipulate the Zero Point to create a tear through both space and time to actually enter The In Between. The rocket went through the rift and boosted out of another one over Moisty Mires, flying around the island to enter another rift near Snobby Shores. Finally, the rocket boosted out of another rift at Loot Lake and accelerated into the sky, blasting through space-time and creating a gigantic rift in the sky, known as the Sideways Rift. This rift did not close, and instead slowly grew over the days until Season 5, indicating that the Visitor significantly fractured reality to a point that it began destabilizing further. As the Sideways Rift continued to grow, smaller rifts began opening around the island, rifting different objects from the island.

The Sideways Rift collides different realities together, and a large number of map changes occur. In the end of the season, The Sideways Rift above the Island starts to shrink and change from blue to purple color, meaning that the fabric of reality is healing, but The Last Reality has taken control of it. (We gonna talk about them later)
The Sideways Rift begins to shoot lightning bolts at a hill in the desert, eventually culminating in the formation of The Cube. The Sideways Rift closes in the process. This was a method that The Last Reality used to transport one of its cubes to the island, with the goal to locate The Zero Point and destroy Reality Zero (Fortnite's Omniverse).  The Cube rolls around the island, imprinting seven glyphs into the ground at different locations and arrives to fund in loot lake. The Cube's matter begins to gather towards the Loot Lake island, and forms the cube underneath the central island. The Cube rips out the island and and lifts it into the air, keeping it suspended with a tornado like vortex. A purple whirlpool lies where the island once rested, likely leading to The Vault (the place where the zero point hides). The Floating Island violently explodes, causing it to split into 3 island. The cube material that grew through the house was blasted out and scattered across the island. The Cube begins to lose energy and the outer shell cracks and melts off into the vortex. (presumably into The Zero Point). After this, the "Butterfly Event" started, all the loopers started to attack the cube and managed to make him explose, partially damaging the Zero Point and sending all loopers into "The In Between", which is some withe interdenominational thing, its the first time we see it. While everyone was "in the In between" an entity in a form of a butterfly comes to the player and send him back to the "normal world".

After this some Ice King came but nobody cares about this part, all we need to remember is that it ended with the creation of a volcano and the massive excavation site at Loot Lake reveals "The Vault", a gate that leads to the Imagined Order's realm of the Zero Point. After some weird futuristic structure came out from nowhere and make The Vault open, the "Unvaulting Event" started. The Vault is opened and The Loopers select The Drum Gun to be unvaulted ( yee) while there, players notice the desk of Singularity (the guardian of The Vault and probably an old Seven member, The Paradigm) along with her helmet in front o the zero point. When loopers leave the vault, the volcano erupts and shoots out fireballs that destroy some places but most importantly, Polar peek, a mountain that have a giant monster frozen in. In season 9, loopers use the zero point (with the help of singularity) as an energy source and make futuristic city's and a statute of Singularity (this will be important later). Near the end of the season 9, the Polar peek monster managed to escape and is now in the water around the island. after this, Singularity (Aka The Paradigm) builded a giant mecha to fight the monster, aka "The Devourer". the mecha and the Devourer battle against each other. The Devourer tries to obtain the Zero Point by attempting to break into The Vault, but is interrupted by the Mecha. Following a brutal attack, the mecha is severely damaged, so it breaks into The Vault and rips out The Zero Point, obtaining some of its power in a desperate last resort to save the reality. With its newfound energy, the Mecha punches the Devourer and sends it tumbling away. The Singularity Statue is revealed to be a giant blade, and the Mecha uses the Zero Point energy to charge it and make it stronger. In the final showdown, The Mecha stabs The Devourer through the head, defeating the beast once and for all. The zero point is now severely damaged and dangerous for reality itself.

We are now in Season X. The zero point explodes and make some serious damage to the reality causing temporal anomaly's. The season 4 meteor is now frozen into the sky and have not destroyed anything. Inside the meteor, we can find a new "space capsule", a new member of the Seven is revealed, The Scientist. But the I.O manipulated him to come for fixing the zero point, they probably knew what will happen. The Scientist builded multiples rift beacons around the island to make come back old/new places of the Island like Gotham City. Meanwhile the Scientist is making a new rocket. The Visitor (who probably came back) created several tapes. They were able to be collected and cryptically described his plans and attempts to remember his plan during the Looping process. Now, the end is near, The Scientist sets The Seven's plan into motion, and The Scientist takes off into the sky, before rifting away. The seven sideways rifts created by the rift beacons each acted as a way for The Seven and each of their rockets to get to the island. In an effort to stabilize the Bridge, The Seven unfreeze the meteor and slam it into The Zero Point to contain it from destroying Reality Zero. This causes The Zero Point to contain the loop's matter into a black hole. As matter goes into the Black Hole, the Loop's structure changes. This completes the mission of The Seven. Throughout the next two days of The Nothing, a new island is constructed out of the matter from the old island.

The I.O sended a scout squad to explore the new island, the E.G.O team. A.L.T.E.R, a criminal organization formed by Midas (i'll talk about him later) begins to unfold on the island, several of its members resemble members of E.G.O. Chaos Agent (some random skin) seems to be the leader. A.L.T.E.R also has an important connection with Slurp Co (all the shield potions thing and Kevolution Energy (they make energy with the cube power). Meanwhile, with the insane amount of energy that the zero point used to recreate an island, Galactus (yes the big boi from Marvel) noticed this energy. A new character arrives, Midas, some peoples speculate that he is an ex employee of the I.O and wanted to free the loopers. Midas set his sights on building an empire of espionage, intrigue, and conquest. He founded the Shadow and Ghost organization. His plan was to create the "Doomsday Device", a machine that have for objetive to destroy the storm (and the loop) After creating a team of agent for his project (including Deadpool) ,Midas (and his daughter Jules) active the Doomsday device it brings Loopers out of the Loop multiple times and battles against the Storm in an attempt to destroy it.  The Bridge is first revealed to the Loopers, and The Imagined Order is confused about what is happening with the loop, attempting to restore order to the island. After The Device manages to succeed in destroying the physical form of The Storm, The wall of water is created by The Storm as revenge against Midas. The I.O manage to contain The Wall of Water behind the storm barrier and predict that the wall will not hold for long before it collapses and and a flood is unleashed across the island. The Island is now underwater but not for long. And also Aquaman joined the Loop. Now The Nexus war is happening, Galactus is coming to the island to eat the Zero point and take his energy but will destroy reality if he does it, Thor tried to stopped him bu couldn't. He now gonna build a teal to stop Galactus.

Galactus and Thor (in an other dimension) needed energy to stop the "Black Winter" some bad thing in the Marvel universe. Thor came to the island with the reality rift Galactus he him saw. He used the Bifröst to bring (the comics versions of:) Iran man, Shehulk, Wolverine, Mystique, Doctor Doom, Groot, Captain America, and Storm ( but they start to slowly lose their memories because of the loop).At this time, Galactus is visible as a red dot in the sky. The center of the island became a junkyard for sentinels, 'decommissioned' by Wolverine. E.G.O and A.L.T.E.R have left the island or collapsed.Iron man set up and activated the rift beacons around the island, bringing his Stark industries labs to find a way to stop Galactus. He finnaly find a way to stop him by upgrading the battle bus with stark technology and gamma bombs inside of them.Galactus arrives onto the island and rips The Zero Point from The Bridge, cracking its outer shell to absorb its energy. The Zero Point seems to have fought back against Galactus, and sucked the entire island into The In-Between. There, Galactus continued to attempt to consume The Zero Point, while Iron Man and the other superheroes rally the billions of battle buses that Tony Stark had modified and cloned using The Loop. Following a battle with Galactus, he is tricked into consuming all of the buses, and the gamma cells are detonated. This injures Galactus and blasts him through a rift, completing the mission of The Avengers, as Galactus is now defeated. Meanwhile, The Bridge was severely damaged by the event, and Agent Jones was knocked out. Because yes, there is not only one Jonesy out here, you may noticed that there is sometime multiples character with the same face (especially Jonesy) Thats because when someone leaves the loop, the zero point is making a copy of the lad who leaved, we call them a "Snapshot" and Agent Jones (the blond guy in suit) enter and leaved the loop multiples times. After this event, the I.O is on alert.

The I.O sended Agent Jones recruit the "best hunters" to stop anyone to leave the loop because now, the zero point in (again) vulnerable. Among these hunters we can find : The Mandalorian, Master chief, Kratos, Helen Ripley and the Xenomorph, Michonne and Daryl from Walking dead, Chun Li and Ryu from Street Fighter, Sarah Connor, and the T-8000 Predator and more (i hate this game). Agent Jones also also possesses a portal device with him which protects against the effects of The Loop. I.O guards are also now everywhere, preventing loopers from escaping The Loop. The Zero Point has become more unstable due to the reality hops John Jones makes. It turns more purple and shockwaves every 8 minutes. It shockwaves more frequently every day but comes up with a plan to stabilize the Zero Point. However, he is locked out of gaining access to files related to The Seven by The Imagined Order. His last reality log outlines how he has given everything to the IO for nothing. Frustrated with the IO's carelessness to him and containing The Zero Point, he steals the files himself.  Agent Jones goes rogue and disobeys Doctor Slone to avoid all contact with The Seven (as The Seven wants to destroy IO),and summons The Foundation by throwing his calibrated portal device into The Zero Point, who then arrives in a meteor capsule. The meteor capsule is most likely to trick the I.O into thinking The Seven were located in space, not underneath the island. Jonesy is instantly attacked by The Foundation due to being a member of IO, but the latter is persuaded by Jones to stand down and help him by promising him Genō and The Sisters in exchange for fixing The Zero Point. The Foundation gives Jones his Portal Device, and is ordered to close all of the portals formed by "reality breaking down".The Looper takes on the task after Jones is turned into a Rift Butterfly by a reality wave. After the portals are closed, The Foundation forces The Zero Point to bloom.

The Foundation is forced to create "The Spike" to contain the blast from the upcoming implosion and stop the I.O for temporarily using the Zero Point. But Before sealing himself into The Zero Point, he tells Jones (who had turned back into a human) to overload The Portal Device and throw it into The Zero Point to allow the process to work. The Device is destroyed, Agent Jones becomes trapped in The Loop, The Foundation is sealed within The Zero Point, but the island is saved. As a result of the event, a reality wave forces the island to go wild, with the central island converted from a desert into an autumn-themed biome. The Foundation after some days trapped inside The Spike try to communicate with crystals on it, the messages are decrypted by the loopers and the help of Raz (some chaman guy taht gets corrupted by thoses crystals and start to attract "unwanting attentions" later) . The message says : Find, Jones, after talking with several Jones snapshots and others peoples around the Island,  reveals that large amount of water can stop the effects of the Loop. and that the Loop can overwrite memory, not just reset. Meanwhile, a Rift appears above Gotham City, where it pulls the Batman into the Island and into The Loop. he quickly realized his memories are fading. He then sees the Storm closing in, and after running and observing its unnatural behavior, he speculates that it is being controlled by an external force. Batman is ambushed by a looper and when trying to interrogate him, he notices that he cannot speak. He wonders if this is some sort of training ground, an asylum, or a prison.He meets Catwoman shortly afterward, though neither of them remember who the other is. They end up defeating all other characters on the island, presumably dying to the Storm. details the events of Batman's time trapped within the Loop.

Batman discovers that the Loop resets roughly every twenty-two minutes from notes he left to himself in previous Loop cycles.
Batman eventually meets Catwoman in the Loop, and though they do not remember each other due to the Loop's memory wiping effects, Batman still somehow feels he "knows" her after seeing her, leading to them working together in future Loop cycles. This confirms that while the Loop wipes away memories, the individuals feelings and emotions still remain. (All these events are recited in the Batman Zero Point Comic book btw) Snake-Eyes and Batman have an ongoing battle every time they meet in the Loop. Eventually Batman convinces Snake-Eyes to let him win so he escapes the Loop.
Batman successfully escapes the loop but is confronted by Deathstroke who is holding Catwoman hostage. Batman and his new team goes into the hidden bunker. They find 2 Golems protecting the entrance and IO Guards acting as the security. The original Fishstick is killed by an imposter ( :roachpussy: ) in the team. They eventually break into the The Bridge. They break into the Zero Point Chamber and powers the panels after discovering that entering the Zero Point directly would rip you apart between many realities. Using the panels to lock onto some of the characters’ universal signatures allowed them to send everyone back to their respective homeworld. Batman returns to his home in Reality: NF-1935 and regains all of his memory. After this Doctor Slone, The Batman Who Laughs and Lex Luthor open a Sideways Rift above Metropolis (Where Superman came from). They were rumors of the arrivals of "aliens" Dr.Slone and the I.O try to shut the theories but the Alien come in the Island. Their faction name is "The last reality". The Last Reality arrives on the island, an alien faction with the apparent goal to take over all of reality. They use The Mothership (their base of operations on the mission) to blow up The Spire and attempt to absorb The Zero Point.

However, they did not find The Zero Point, due to the fact that it was moved down into The Bridge to allow Batman and the others to escape Reality Zero. These events also resulted in The Foundation being ejected from The Zero Point into Reality NF-1935 and thrown into an ocean. The Foundation is now in the Batman reality.  Following the failure of their plan, The Last Reality invaded the island, and The Imagined Order sprang into action, revealing themselves to the island's inhabitants, with Doctor Slone taking charge of, and leading the fight against The Last Reality. Seven Satellite Stations are constructed around the island to monitor The Mothership and its future plan. The Kymera's (the alien race name) start taking over multiples places over the island meanwhile Dr.Slone is trying to fight them back. Some moles leaks I.O's operations project to the public. It is revealed that The Last Reality are secretly transmitting subliminal messages that reportedly hijacks higher brain function, set up by them. The Rift Tour (a concert with Arian Grande like the Travis Scott one) is orchestrated by The Last Reality to scan the memories of each looper and gain a deeper understanding of the island's history and The Zero Point. And also Superman join the loop and start losing his memories and ask the Loopers to help him regains his memories. The Mothership is taking away one of the location on the map, The Dr.Slone plan is to attach bombs under the floattings part to make the Mothership explode. After the release of the Among Us Fortnite Gamemode (wich take place inside The Bridge) we can see that the I.O The , which shows off the most in-depth look yet into the Imagined Order's top secret Facility, The Bridge, which was first seen during The Device event in Chapter 2: Season 2. 


In the Trust Nobody teaser trailer, it is said that the IO have 'run things successfully for thousands of years.' It is then shown that the IO control almost everything that goes on inside the Loop, from loading chests with weapons, to producing Supply Drops and Supply Llamas. It is also said that due to John Jones' 'betrayal' during Zero Crisis Finale event, other unknown members of the IO have also started to defect against the IO. Doctor Slone believes that Jones 'wasn't working alone'. Although the defecting IO Agents are more likely just following in his example instead. The Zero Point also appears to have been successfully re-contained in the Zero Point Chamber, and is stable and undamaged. After a lot of quest that Dr.Slone gave to the loopers to prepare their operation and the elimination of the mole that Dr.Slone called a "warmongering charlatan", The Operation Skyfire is ready.  Doctor Slone gathers numerous Loopers to ride with the bombs attached to the floating islands. Once abducted, Slone hacks the Alien Jetpacks on the Loopers to free them from the experiment prison cells, and the Loopers race through the halls of The Mothership's interior.
Eventually, the Loopers reach a room with a shallow pool of purple liquid and large glass windows overlooking the abduction chamber, providing a clear view of the bomb-laden island chunks within. When Slone attempts to arm the bombs, the chamber windows suddenly shut, and The Cube emerges from the liquid, shocking Slone, who states that she thought the Cube was destroyed for good during Season 6. The Cube unleashes powerful blasts of energy to knock out some of the Loopers, before Slone weaponizes the packs and disables the Cube, turning it black. With the arming sequence this time successful, Slone praises the Loopers for doing their part, but then reveals she will not be rescuing the Loopers, as she does not want to risk the Cube returning to the Island, and leaves them to die

The Loopers then discover they can reboot the Cube, turning it blue, and in turn causing the platform they're standing to function as an elevator ascending further into the mothership as the countdown continues. The platform emerges in a massive chamber, where countless more dormant Cubes light up one by one, including one Golden Cube, revealing themselves as the power source of the Mothership. The bombs then detonate, causing the entire Mothership to explode and ejecting the loopers by the blast, where they plummet to the ground, and can only watch as the island is bombarded with debris and cubes, before ultimately they are hit by a falling Saucer. The Imagined Order have destroyed The Mothership, but the malicious ruler of The Last Reality, The Cube Queen, was unknowingly brought to the island along with her Cube Legion, a sub-faction of The Last Reality that concerns the cubes. The Cube Queen had stayed encased within The Gold Cube in The Mothership throughout Season 7, but the destruction of The Mothership resulted in The Golden Cube landing on the island, worsening the problem for IO, which they may or may not be aware of at this stage. In fact, The Imagined Order had already started cleanup efforts, and Dr.Slone had remained on the island with a group of IO guards to salvage the alien technology on the island and transport it away for research. After some times, The Cube Queen set up in the middle of the island and start preparing her ultimate powers. The Foundation finally awakens on the seabed of Reality 'NF-1935', in Gotham City's harbor. The AI assistant in his armor retells the events of the Zero Crisis Finale as he swims to the surface. Upon leaving the ocean he is confronted by the Batman, who believes the Foundation to be one of the individuals who controls the Loop, and furthermore the Island. After a brief skirmish where Batman states that he was able to reach the Zero Point himself.

The sky darkens quickly as The Cube Queen awakens after a long period of dormancy, shooting a large beam of energy into the sky and opening a portal to another reality, where countless Motherships, and one unknown Megaship are waiting. Dozens of Abductors and Saucers are deployed, swarming the island (it is worth noting that all of the Abductors and Motherships are Golden in colour, unlike the Season 7 ones, which were purple, possibly signifying ranks within The Last Reality or simply being a division that is directly commanded by the Cube Queen). The saucers overwhelm the shield of the blue cube, while Caretakers storm The Guava Fort and terrorize the Loopers, as the Cube Queen laughs maniacally. The Loopers are disarmed by weapon abduction and The Blue Cube is destroyed by an Abductor, leaving them helpless, as The Cube Queen taunts them by repeatedly saying that they cannot escape The Last Reality.
Meanwhile, in The Bridge facility, Doctor Slone and an unknown man prepare to execute Agent Jones for treason, who was captured following The Zero Crisis Finale and imprisoned by IO. However, before Jones could be killed, The Foundation breaks into the room and kills the IO guards and unknown man, before freeing Jones. Slone, stunned, remarks how she thought that The Foundation was killed sometime earlier, to which The Foundation seals her in the room (The Foundation is also revealed to be portrayed by Dwayne Johnson). The duo rush down The Bridge hallway, taking out IO guards in the process, before they ultimately arrive in the Zero Point containment chamber. Jones uses a knocked over cube monolith panel as cover from the attacking IO guards, while The Foundation reverses the gyroscopic orientation of the island in order to completely flip it and defeat The Cube Queen. 

After the flipping process begins, The Foundation orders 'Phase Two'. On the surface, The Visitor and The Scientist arrive to rescue the helpless Loopers. As The Visitor fights off the Caretakers, The Scientist breaks into the IO Hatch near Guava Fort. The Visitor then departs the island, while The Scientist leads The Loopers in. The Scientist hacks the entrance to The Bridge and the group heads inside, navigating through the endless hallways as the island has already rotated by 30 degrees, and objects start sliding and tumbling down. The group then arrive at the Zero Point chamber, where they meet The Foundation. The Scientist assures The Loopers that although the suface is lost, they will be safe in The Bridge. Afer Jones expresses his uncertainty around the glass panel separating The Bridge with the ocean, The Scientist tells him that it will hold, as it is rated for 1 thousand times the atmospheric pressure. As if on cue, A caretaker attacks, and breaks the glass panel, flooding and destroying The Bridge. The Looper that the player is controlling is sucked out from the facility, and thrown around violently, before they ultimately resurface and watch as the entire island now stands nearly 90 degrees upright, with an entirely new island on the other side of the Chapter 2 island. The Cube Queen is then plunged into the ocean, which closes the portal above the island and seals the rest of The Last Reality's fleet from Reality Zero. Only two abductors remain, and those are soon crushed by the rotating island. As the Chapter 2 island sinks, and the new one resurfaces, a tsunami created from the falling island slams into The Looper and knocks them out. 

The Island has been flipped. After The Cube Queen's final assault on the Island and the presumed destruction of The Bridge that housed The Zero Point at the hands of The Seven and John Jones, the Island had flipped entirely upside down and thus has revealed a whole new world, and the third iteration of the Island. The Scientist attempts to reach The Paradigm, informing her that they need her help. He indicates that something happened between her and The Seven, but that grudges must be put aside. Not long after, he recieves a ping from the Paradigm, but needs to confirm her identity to make sure it's really her.But he Scientist detected some unnatural earthquake around the Island caused by something stronger than The Looper's heart beat. Something is drilling from below. The first of the Imagined Order's Mole Teams, Mole Team: Omega, surfaces on the Island. A Driller can be seen beside a mound of dirt with tread tracks leading to the Driller itself, and a small camp has been made around the surfacing site. The Scientist's retrieval rocket sent to retrieve The Seven's "wartime essentials" from space returns to the Launchpad after failing its mission, this leads The Scientist to recruit The Looper to acquire telescope parts to improve the next rocket. The first rocket failed likely due in part to 'someone' that the Scientist mentioned when stating "somebody really doesn’t want us to do that", in reference to the mission itself. The previously mentioned tension amongst members of The Seven, such as the group's apparent distrust of The Paradigm that lead to some sort of falling out between them, potentially implies this 'someone' to either be The Visitor or The Foundation, as they currently are the only other members of The Seven on the Island.

The I.O succeed to reach the surface with drills. The Scientist's Fifth audio log details that The Paradigm has "accessed her navigational accounts and appears to be preparing for a long journey", leading him to "strongly suggest we prioritize all Paradigm-related engineering" in preparation for her supposed arrival.
Earthquakes caused by the Imagined Order's underground drilling operation begin occurring, causing varying levels of destruction across different points of the Island. The first earthquake began at at Covert Cavern.The earthquakes themselves seem to be caused by further IO drilling activity underneath the Island's surface, and according to The Scientist, this drill is much larger than those at the Mole Team sites.*/
